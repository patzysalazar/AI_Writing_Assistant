## Challenges I Faced
**Challenge 1: JSON and HTTP URL Connections**
Problem: Learning what HTTP URL connections and JSON are and implementing them within my code
Solution: Watched a couple of videos and used AI to help me understand the concepts
Learned: I learned about the request body and its implementations when accessing my API key. 

**Challenge 2: Writing view to controller connections of buttons**
Problem: I had a hard time with adding exceptions and creating connections to the different writing modes from my writing view to the controller.
Solution: I Had to implement the specific ID within my view and call the buttons within my controller to be able to adjust the behaviors of selections within the app.
Learned:I learned about the different text area and radio button features and how within my code they are used to create exceptions and handle error when a client is using my app.


## Design Pattern Justifications
**Strategy Pattern:** - Different writing mode(Creative, professional, and academic) based on the radio buttons
**Factory Pattern:**  - creating writing request object where it sets the prompt, mode and limits tokens
**Observer Pattern:**  - WritingController is the observer since it must run when receiving a client response

## AI Usage (BE HONEST!)
I Used ChatGPT to understand JSON and the HTTPURLConnection concepts as I had no idea how to implement them in my code or how it worked. I explained what it does within the video and made sure really analyze the steps. Within my last weeks of school I was able to learn about HTTP requests through my Web Design course so now I seem to be a bit more familiar with the concepts. But JSON was a completely new concept that I had to learn by watching several youtube videos and through ChatGPT. Most of the time I would try to implement my own knowledge but get help with syntax if it wasn't correct with JSON and HTTPConnections.What also helped with that was the music recommender code as well
## Time Spent: ~4 days cumulative in hours roughly
